OHSAS, a group of interested parties first released its 18001 standard in 1999. The standard was updated in 2007. In 2018, ISO superseded this standard with a new ISO standard, ISO 45001.\n\nISO 45001 was developed by a diverse standards committee, the same as other standards to help all types of organizations reduce, and where possible eliminate injury and illness.", 
                        "- Establishing the context of your organization as it relates to health and safety, determining risk and identifying actions to address the risks\n- Identifying health and safety hazards applicable to the organization's operations\n- Assessing the level of risk associated with the hazard\n- Identifying controls to minimize risks\n- Identifying sources of data to monitor, measure, report, and analyze\n- Investigation and taking action in case of nonconformance, injury, or illness\n- Identifying corrective actions from non-conformances and incidents to prevent further incident\n\nAs with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, it is good management practice to develop written occupational health and safety policies and procedures. Written policies and procedures are effective for helping an organization plan, communicate, check, enforce, and continually improve so that an organization is better able to ensure the health and safety of its employees and others affected by its operations.\n\nIf understood and implemented correctly, an ISO 45001 safety management system could easily pay for itself financially. Consider the cost of injury, illness, legalities, negative press, and stress that come from poor health and safety, and consider the benefit that comes from taking a planned and informed approach to safety management. Do it for your employees and for peace of mind. Both you and your employees will be grateful you did.\n\nAchieving certification to ISO 45001 demonstrates to others your commitment to health and safety and can be effectively used in marketing campaigns.\n\n"

While this is not currently a requirement in the US, there is a US law that is similar in almost all aspects to ISO 13485, which is 21 CFR Part 820. Most US companies looking to send product outside of the US will also get ISO 13485 Certification.\n\nPutting the regulatory considerations aside, implementing an ISO management system standard into your business represents good management practice, or in the case of medical devices “Good Manufacturing Practice [GMP].” By implementing ISO 13485, an organization becomes a better bet for their suppliers.\n\nWhat is the role of the customers in all of this? Of course, the customer is also king, and all the regulations in the world make no difference to your business if you can’t attract and satisfy your customers enough. Many companies can design product and promote, but it is the consistent quality and attention to customer satisfaction that brings long-term success in the market. Customer satisfaction, of course, is a prime goal of the ISO 13485 standard; no wonder it’s appealing to customers.\n\nProving yourself as a good and consistent supplier to your customer can be improved by certification to an ISO management system standard. As the importance of compliance and satisfaction grows, you will be able to draw the attention of a number of customers who will not work with non-ISO certified organizations. Many organizations are finding that no matter how good their product is, customers need more reassurance, they want their suppliers to be certified. Moreover, many organizations are finding that losing even one contract can well pay for the cost of implementing good management practice and getting certified. If your management system was well documented and implemented, you just might even enjoy life a little more with the knowledge that your business is in safe hands and operated, as it should.\n\nFor medical device manufacturers or suppliers who are looking for opportunities to grab new markets, conformity with regulatory requirements is a mandate.

The QuEST forum has a global reach. The content of TL 9000 is chosen by its members who are made up of representatives from the telecommunications industry.\n\nTL 9000 is based on ISO 9001 with a number of adders that are specific to telecommunications. Most adders are relevant to all suppliers, but there are some adders that are specific to hardware, software, or services, or a combination of either.\n\nTL 9000 is truly unique. As part of the requirements for certification, applicants also need to submit performance data to a database that is managed in Texas. The submission of performance data helps to push and promote continual improvement for the whole of the telecommunications industry. So far, statistics show that organizations with TL 9000 certification are indeed improving on a number of important performance criteria. As with other standards such as: ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems, ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems and ISO 45001 Occupation Health & Management Systems (OHSMS), the requirements of each standard are designed to integrate well between each other. This means that dual certification with another management system standard is simplified.\n\n"

This level will require multi-factor authentication to access CUI data, and level 2 brings 115 additional security controls to level 1.\n\nLevel 3: Good Cyber Hygiene\n\tLevel 3 includes coverage for all controls and cybersecurity practices that are not mentioned in the CUI protection scope.

The processes at this level need to be reviewed, properly managed with resources, and improved constantly in the contractor company. This level adds another 95 security controls.\n\nLevel 5: Advanced/Progressive\n\tAs the last and most important level, level 5 incorporates the most advanced, sophisticated practices for optimizing cybersecurity to address all APTs. The processes of contractors that come under this level need to be consistently enhanced. This level has 34 extra security controls over the previous 4 levels.",

By becoming R2 certified, an organization is able to demonstrate that it is environmentally and ethically responsible for all electronic goods it processes from receipt to its final resting spot or re-use.\n\nTo become certified, an organization must also achieve certification to ISO 45001 Occupational Health & Safety Management and ISO 14001 Environmental management standards. While this is a requirement, much of the remaining sections of the R2 standard will also be met by achieving certification to these two standards.\n\nWhile achieving certification to R2 does not guarantee full compliance with EPA requirements, the ongoing certification helps to demonstrate that your organization will continually meet environmental and safety standards.\n\nBy undergoing the R2 compliance and documentation process, an organization is less likely to be found non-compliant which would save on costs and penalties associated with noncompliance.\n\nWhile still a voluntary standard, R2 is fast becoming the benchmark for e-recycling. As many are finding with the other management system standards mentioned in our webpage, organizations that are not certified may soon find out that they are precluded from some important contracts. Currently, R2 certification will set you apart from others. Potentially, this certification may become the benchmark. Achieving certification is relatively simple once you have certification to ISO 45001 and ISO 14001, so there is no better time than now to obtain this certification.",

For instance, computers, printers, and fax machines, etc.\n\nWhat should be included in a scope statement? All activities, which are related to electronics refurbishing/reselling/recycling taking place at an organization.\n\nSometimes, activities related to electronics recycling may be only a small portion of the company’s total business operations. Non-R2 related activities should not be included in the R2 scope statement.\n\nThe scope statement must be consistent with any Allowances, which have been mentioned in the R2 Code Of Practice.\n\nAn unacceptable scope statement will delay a company’s registration on the SERI website directory.",
